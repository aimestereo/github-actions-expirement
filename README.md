# GitHub only SDLC

Demo project to test how much of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) pipeline I can set up and comfortable use without integrating with other services.

Goals, to use only:
* GitHub Projects and Issues instead of Jira or similar services
* GitHub actions for tests instead of TravisCI, Jenkins...
* GitHub environments for complex deployment rules and protections

What I intend to use:
* [Cloudcraft](https://cloudcraft.co) and [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io) for infrastructure as code
* AWS as cloud provider
* [Next js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) default app as site base.
